Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and to certain other software designed to be
useful with such libraries.  The LGPL gives developers and companies
the right to link to open source libraries and distribute code that
uses those libraries under terms of their choice, while ensuring that
improvements to the LGPL-covered components remain available to the
community under the same license.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and to certain other software designed to be
useful with those libraries.  The LGPL permits developers and
companies to use and integrate LGPLed software into their own (even
proprietary) software without being required to release the source
code of their own components, under certain conditions described in
this license.

  When a program links to a library, whether statically or dynamically,
the combination of the two is legally speaking a derivative work of the
library, and the terms of the LGPL apply to the combined work in the
sense that the user must be able to modify and relink the LGPL-covered
library. This license ensures that the library itself remains free,
while allowing it to be used by non-(L)GPLed programs.

  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms
  of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and give any other recipients of the Library a copy of
  this License along with the Library.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at least
    under the terms of this License to suitable recipient(s) so that
    they, too, can copy and distribute the modified version of the
    Library.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To
  do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,
  so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, and
  then follow the procedures indicated in that License.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
  your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
  copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
  licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
  compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with, or modify the
  Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
  further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
  granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
  third parties with this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
  not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
  this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
  consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,
  if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
  the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
  through you, then the only way you could distribute the Library
  would be to obtain a separate license for each recipient, or to
  arrange for redistribution in such a way that recipients only
  receive the Library through some program that on behalf of all
  recipients receives such a license. However, if you provide a
  copy of the Library in object code form under the terms of Section
  6, accompanied by the information required by Section 6, then the
  recipient is allowed to redistribute the object code version under
  the terms of this License, subject to the other conditions herein.
